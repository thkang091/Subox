Examples:
- "This IKEA Malm desk has been my study companion through two semesters and it's in amazing condition! The spacious surface easily fits a laptop, textbooks, and coffee mug - perfect for those late-night study sessions. The clean white finish will match any dorm aesthetic and the sturdy build means it'll last through graduation. Asking $45, pickup only in Dinkytown!"

- "Barely used Hamilton Beach microwave that's been a lifesaver for quick meals between classes! Works perfectly with all the preset functions, and the compact size is ideal for dorm rooms or small apartments. No more expensive campus food when you can heat up leftovers in seconds. Selling for $30 and I can deliver within 2 miles!"
